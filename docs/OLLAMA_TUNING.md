# Ollama DeepSeek Tuning Notes

## Test Harness
- Commands were issued via the voice loop prompt builder (`pxh.voice_loop.build_model_prompt`) using the current `state/session.json`.
- Each configuration evaluated the same five prompts:
  1. "Give a friendly hello to the lab."
  2. "Summarize the latest weather quickly."
  3. "Check the sensors and tell me the battery status."
  4. "Stop everything immediately if needed."
  5. "Thanks, end the session safely."
- Responses were sent to the Ollama HTTP API (`/api/generate`) with `format="json"`; success required:
  - A valid JSON payload
  - A recognised tool from `{tool_status, tool_circle, tool_figure8, tool_stop, tool_voice, tool_weather}`
- Latency was measured wall-clock per request.

## Summary Results
| Config | Options | Avg latency | Max latency | JSON/tool failures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `deepseek-coder:1.3b` (temperature 0.2) | default settings | 38.5 s | 148.3 s | 1/5 |
| `deepseek-coder:1.3b` (temperature 0.2, `num_predict` 64) | limit tokens | **12.0 s** | **17.8 s** | **0/5** |
| `deepseek-coder:1.3b` (temperature 0.2, `num_predict` 32) | tighter token cap | 11.1 s | 15.5 s | 1/5 |
| `deepseek-coder:1.3b` (temperature 0.0) | deterministic | 44.3 s | 137.2 s | 1/5 |
| `deepseek-coder:1.3b` (temperature 0.4) | higher randomness | 16.9 s | 21.0 s | 2/5 |
| `deepseek-r1:1.5b` (temperature 0.1) | reasoning model | 80.2 s | 200.3 s | 2/5 |

**Recommended defaults:** `deepseek-coder:1.3b` with `temperature=0.2` and `num_predict=64` – fastest configuration with zero malformed responses. Use `CODEX_OLLAMA_TEMPERATURE` and `CODEX_OLLAMA_NUM_PREDICT` to override.

## Next Checks
- Periodically rerun the harness after model upgrades or prompt changes.
- Consider scripted retries when the model emits narration instead of a tool command.
- Explore quantised variants if CPU load becomes an issue.
